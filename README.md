# Classification_using_logistic_regression

Logistic Regression model from scratch, for binary prediction outcomes 

## Abstract
This project carries out the explanatory data analysis of the titanic dataset, for finding an appropriate preprocessing strategy, before training and feeding the dataset into a predictive model, to predict whether a ceratin passanger, given their characteristics, the combination of both continuous and catagororical variables, would have survived the titanic shipwreck. Two versions of the logistic regression model, with and without using the ridge regression regularisation, was constructed, using the sigmoid function and gradient descent from scratch, without using the built-in logistic regression function, and a binary classifier was built, where in this case, the threshold probalility was set at 0.5. 

This project was part of the Machine Learning with Python module, at Queen Mary University of London, and completed on December 2019
